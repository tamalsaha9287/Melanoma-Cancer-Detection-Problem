# Melanoma Skin Cancer Detection Problem
> Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. We are looking for a solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.


## Table of Contents
* [General Info] Here we are leveraging a dataset consists of 2357 images of malignant and benign oncological diseases, which were formed from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC). All images were sorted according to the classification taken with ISIC, and all subsets were divided into the same number of images, with the exception of melanomas and moles, whose images are slightly dominant. Overall data is classified into 9 distinct categories.
* [Technologies Used] Developing a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma
* [Conclusions] This model will screen images and classify them under one of those 9 categories estimating the probabilities


<!-- You can include any other section that is pertinent to your problem -->


## Conclusions
- CNN helped us classify new images under one of those 9 categories
- There was problem of overfitting which was taken care off
